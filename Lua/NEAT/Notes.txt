Test run #1
1) Suffered from an issue where mario locations would encounter an overflow value of 64000 for thier fitness in world 4-4, poluting the gene pool
	-- Fixed by removing 4-4 from the available Mario Moments
2) Mario learned to run and jump, but not when to effectively do so.  Also, Mario would randomly just stop after going forward for a bit.
1) 375 total generations

Test run #2
1) Initial fitness starts negative and if a genome is able to beat a level, the fitness is reduced by 100 or more.
2) Loading a random moment each run is leading to an exploding search space and may be detrimental to training.
   I believe I need to make a shuffled list of moments for the poplulation and give rewards to a genome when it completes a moment.
3) There is a bug where the algorithm doesn't properly detect mario hitting the axe to kill bowser as beating a level.
4) 1042 total generations

Test run #3
1) The bot learned to complete 90% of the first moment in a week of training
2) All genomes seemed to get stuck in the same place
3) 309 total generations

Test run #4
1) Retuned time penalties to be 1/4 of total frames passed during a run
2) Introduced reshuffling the dataset every generation of training
3) Genomes seem to be able to react to enemies and terrain.
4) One crash after a week and a half of training.
5) Max Fitness should be reset for every generation
6) Add penalties for death and rewards for completing a level & being alive when the run is cut off
7) Potentially add small reward for killing an enemy
8) 2167 total generations

Test run #5
1) Added a reward for mario being alive and making progress when a run is over
2) Added small reward for killing enemies
3) Reset maxfitness for every generation
4) Mario basically learned to move forward a step and then end the run
5) 610 total generations

Test run #6
1) Tuning reward for staying alive to require a forward velocity greater than 6
2) Adding reward for a successful jump
3) Adding reward for maintaining high speed
